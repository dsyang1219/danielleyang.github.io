            <h1>Hello, I'm Danielle Yang!</h1>
            <p>I am currently a high school senior at Bloomington High School South. I am planning to pursue data science at an accredited four-year university with the dream of eventually becoming a
                scientist that utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze pandemics and guide data-driven public health policies. I am a research intern at the Observatory on Social Media at Indiana University, a part-time student at Indiana University, 
                and a Cambridge Center for International Research (CCIR) Future Scholar and scholarship recipient.
            </p>
