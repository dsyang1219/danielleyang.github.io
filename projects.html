                <h2>Storm Shield</h2>
                <p>A weather-resistant headband designed to protect athletes' hearing aids and alert users to nearby hazards. The first prototype includes an acoustic hydrophobic mesh and a Passive Infrared Sensor alert system. This project was submitted to the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow competition, and state finalists will be released in January.</p>
