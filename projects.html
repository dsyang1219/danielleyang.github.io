                <h2>Storm Shield</h2>
                <p>A weather-resistant headband designed to protect athletes' hearing aids and alert users to nearby hazards. The first prototype includes an acoustic hydrophobic mesh and an Passive Infrared Sensor alert system. This project was submitted to the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow competition, and state finalists wil be released in January.</p>
